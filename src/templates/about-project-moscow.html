                    <p>Information technologies are one of the most rapidly developing branches of human activity; thus, many investors show special interest in this area. Information technologies have great potential and excellent prospects, and one should not forget that they also have specifics and high risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to statistics, only 10–15% of projects reach the level of self-sufficiency and in the future begin to make a profit, but if it is successfully, the amount of profit can be just huge, which other areas of investment can’t even dream about.</p>
                    <p>An innovative idea and unique team competencies are main points for a successful project.</p>

                    <p>It may seem that there are no areas that do not remain busy in a big city, but this approach is fundamentally wrong, but it’s rather vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>Such city as Moscow constantly requires new enterprises in different fields of activity.
                        Moscow is a perfect place to search for business contacts, there are different events for entrepreneurs and investors held every week, where you can bring your project or find an interesting startup to invest in.</p>
                    <p> The ideology of our foundation is an approximate distribution of funds in the ratio of 80% to fundamental projects (real estate), and 20% is invested in venture capital projects.</p>
                    <p>Some projects are invested, some we develop independently. Moreover, all our projects have between
                        a synergy, real estate objects are also used by our IT companies for meetings, work, team building and recreation.</p>
